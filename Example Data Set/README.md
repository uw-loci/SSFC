2) Use the following settings for this data set:
Processing Mode = Individual Images
Spectral Boundaries = 660, 550, 440 
Data Selection Folder = .\SSFC\Example Data Set\ts_0205_405at370pwr-012
Calibration Selection Folder = .\SSFC\Example Data Set\Calibration Two Component

All other settings can stay as default.

3) Push Process Data

4) When complete Processed Data will be at: .\SSFC\Example Data Set\ts_0205_405at370pwr-012\Processed Data\Individual Spectral Stacks

5) To view the processed data load it into FIJI (https://fiji.sc/)

6) Image -> Color -> Channels Tool ... Ctrl+Shift+Z

7) Select Composite from the drop down

8) Unselect Channel 4 (C4-1x 1y 1z) This "channel" is used to remove the wrap around cross talk generated by the brightness of the DAPI stain. This cross-talk is also visible in Channel 2.
